If you are reading this post, you might be wondering why I decided to get into programming as a career. This is my story, which is much more introspective than my usual technical fare. 

Ever since I was a small child, I have had an interest in computers. One of my oldest memories is installing the original X-Wing in DOS. I remember being absolutely fascinated with how the other space ships in the game decided where to fly and who to shoot! I was blown away when my dad told me it was a computer making all the decisions for the space ships, not other players!

This fascination with computers persisted as I grow up. I have memories of wistfully cracking open books on C and wishing I could understand them.  When I was 10, I created the most 90’s looking webpage ever. I was extremely proud of myself! (Sidenote: <blink> tags are really cool if you are 10). I moved on to creating pages in Dreamweaver, and thought I was just the cat’s pajamas. In High School, My experience with dream weaver and HTML landed me the sweet gig of Assistant Web Master in my local scout troop.

Going off to college, like most people, I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted out of life. Being able to program as a career seemed impossible for someone like me, so I went with Psychology instead. I had my ‘come to Jesus’ moment during an Intro to Neuroscience class.

The professor was discussing how neurons work – they build up an electrical threshold until they reach a certain charge and fire an impulse.  As I heard this, I saw a startling similarity between how the brain works and how computers work at a basic level. A circuit is either on or off – 1 or 0. When this simple binary input coalesces, something beautiful emerges. I get a tingle running down my spine just thinking about it. In a rather round about fashion, I discovered my career path. I can’t (and don’t want!) to be a brain programmer, but I can certainly be a computer programmer. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to switch majors into computer science because of how far I had gotten into my current major. Double majoring was out of question – I was running out of time and money. I took a few lower level computer science classes and tried to be happy with that. 

When I graduated, I knew I wanted to work with computers. Since I have been helping out friends and family with computer issues for a long time, I taught myself the benchmarks for the CompTIA +A certification ( a hardware and software certificate for IT professionals) and passed both tests on the first try. I quickly got a job in the IT industry as a support analyst.

About a year after that, I needed to get an intensive surgery with a lengthy recovery time. I had to take time off work. During those months, to fight restlessness, I started teaching myself Ruby using some tutorials I found on the internet. I fell in love with the language, which also brought with it the understanding I needed to change up my career path a little bit. To live a happy life, I think one needs to be satisfied with their career path. I set my sights on becoming a software engineer, and starting working hard towards that goal. 

Once I was confidant in my dedication to this career evolution, I left my job and taught myself the ins and outs of web development. I know feel as though I have a strong grasp on both frontend and backend development to begin searching for jobs.
